# Funny-Twitter-Bot

I am planning to call this bot the "Funny Twitter Bot". The main purpose of this bot would be to disseminate daily, unique, and entertaining programming-related jokes to its followers. 
I aim to bring a spark of humor and light-heartedness to the coding community on Twitter.

To facilitate the generation of these unique programming jokes, I will be integrating an AI's API into the application. The AI model will be trained to generate programming-related 
jokes based on specific prompts such as "Tell me a hilarious programming/Computer Science joke/meme". This would involve interacting with the AI's API, processing the response, 
and then formatting it into a tweet using Twitter's API.

As a next step, I plan to explore Twitter's streaming APIs to allow real-time reactions to tweets and engagement with the community. For example, the bot could be configured to like 
or retweet any tweet that tags it and uses a specific hashtag.
